I am working as a software engineer at Pony.ai<a href="http://www.pony.ai/"> on autonomous trucking. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UCI Cooperative Systems Lab, advised by Professor Solmaz S. Kia<a href="http://solmaz.eng.uci.edu/">. My research interests include distributed localization, SLAM, and UWB signal processing/communication.
