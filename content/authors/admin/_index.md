I am working as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.pony.ai/">Pony.ai</a> working on motion planning for autonomous trucking. I received my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UCI Cooperative Systems Lab, advised by Professor <a href="http://solmaz.eng.uci.edu/">Solmaz S. Kia</a>. My research interests include distributed localization, SLAM, and motion planning.
