abstract: In this paper, a cooperative navigation algorithm for team of mobile agents is presented. The proposed algorithm is a loosely coupled decentralized algorithm. The setting we consider consists of a set of mobile agents with sensing, processing and communication capabilities. In this setting each agent maintains a local filter to propagate and update its local pose estimates using selfmotion measurements and occasional external absolute measurement signals. Whenever, an agent takes a relative measurement with respect to a teammate, our proposed algorithm enables these two agents to jointly process this relative measurements to update their local estimates in a consistent manner in the absence of exact knowledge about the correlation between their local estimates. Simulations demonstrate the benefits of our proposed algorithm.
