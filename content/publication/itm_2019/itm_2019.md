abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of the Ultra Wide Band (UWB) ranging sensorâ€™s accuracy (both its standard deviation and bias) on a loosely coupled cooperative navigation augmentation for team of pedestrians under GNSS-denied environments. We develop methods to compensate for the UWB ranging bias in none-line-of-sight (NLoS) measurement environments. Our cooperative localization solution in algorithmic level offers a method that does not require any network-wide connectivity among the agents to maintain the consistency of the cooperative localization process. In operational level, we specialize this cooperative localization filter to correctly process the UWB ranging measurements by accurately characterizing the measurement error statistics and compensating for the bias in the measurements. The results contribute to development of a rapidly deployable infrastructure-free localization system to track firefighters inside of a structure such as a building.
